# SpendingTracker
Simple web app to keep track of budget and expenses
The published version can be found here: http://spendingtracker-dev2.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/

The primary intent of this project was to develop a web app that would help me keep better track of how I am spending my money over time.
Like many other spending tracking and budgeting apps, this requires the user to manually update and add expenses. There are 
still several features I would to implement such as charts and graphs that can show the user how their spending has changed
over a given time and into which categories their money is going. As of now, there are still many minor improvements that
can be made such as having a more proper display when incorrect login credentials are provided, adding a 'confirm password' box
to the sign up page, creating an 'About' page, as well as creating a contact page. These are all features that will be rolled
out over time, stay tuned!
